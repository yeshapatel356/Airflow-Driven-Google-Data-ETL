Tim Hortons,"80 Park St E, Windsor, ON N9A 3A7, Canada",4.0,Cirrus Sanofi,"The first sure sign that you're in Canada. You will find a Tim Hortons right next to the tunnel. It was not possible to sit in it, only to order to take it away, Even though they have a large restaurant, it is empty.

Tim Hortons,"80 Park St E, Windsor, ON N9A 3A7, Canada",4.0,KB Holdings,"Lazy and full of excuses. I ordered two steeped teas at the drive thru, I was told there wasn't enough steeped tea for two. I said its ok I'll wait, to which she replied ""I can give you bag tea."" To which I responded ""but I don't want bag tea, I want steeped tea"". Her, ""oh, well I have a lot of people waiting at the counter, so I can't make it"" I just left and went to Crawford, where they're not lazy.

I mean seriously, are you the ONLY ONE working there? Or is everyone else just as lazy and full of excuses as you? You are there to do a job, you are paid to do a job. I know my employer wouldn't keep me if all I put out was excuses for why I can't do the job I'm paid for. Maybe your employer should think about that.",1,a week ago

Tim Hortons,"525 University Ave W, Windsor, ON N9A 5R4, Canada",4.0,Tiny Bird,"The layout on the inside is cramped, with poor choices for the placement of the registers leaving no room for a line to form or for people to wait for their food. The dining area and the exterior could use some work. It cost $14 for a wrap, 2 donuts and a coke. I feel this is a little over sugared and over priced. It did however, taste good. The chicken bacon ranch wrap was especially good.",4,7 months ago
Tim Hortons,"525 University Ave W, Windsor, ON N9A 5R4, Canada",4.0,Sheharyar Arshad,"I had an extremely unpleasant experience at this Tim Hortons branch. The store was noticeably dirty, and to make matters worse, there were a lot of bees inside.

Unfortunately, one of the bees bit me, causing significant swelling and pain. When I brought this to the attention of the cashier, her response was not only unhelpful but also lacked any sense of empathy. She simply said, ""What can I do?"" without even offering an apology.

This kind of customer service is unacceptable, and the store's cleanliness needs serious improvement.

I hope the management takes action to address these issues, as this was a very disappointing experience.",1,a month ago

The service was outstanding, and the food exceeded our expectations. The complimentary bread was delicious, paired with a fresh salad that set the tone for the meal. We ordered the 16 Oz Ribeye steak, cooked medium, and it was perfection‚Äîtender, juicy, and full of flavour, served with creamy mashed potatoes and vegetables. The Linguine Alfredo with Shrimp was another highlight, with the shrimp cooked just right and the sauce rich and flavourful. For dessert, we tried the chef‚Äôs special‚Äîa cinnamon crispy bowl with coconut cream and pineapple. We were initially unsure, but it turned out to be a delightful surprise, with flavors that were both unique and delicious.

Tim Hortons,"800 Wyandotte St E, Windsor, ON N9A 1Z2, Canada",3.6,Cass H,"I am actually pretty annoyed with this location.

I placed an order via the app and this location was the store to service me. I called the store multiple times after placing the order to ask for additional sauce (for the sandwich) and cream (for the icecap). There was no answer.

The food arrived and there was barely any sauce on the sandwich, so it was very dry. I had also ordered a chocolate hazelnut croissant and a donut. The croissant was also pretty dry and the donut was missing.

I called the store the following morning and the manager was very kind and quick to offer a replacement.

I went to pick up the replacement,  the person at drive-thru knew exactly who I was, so I appreciate the communication between employees. But unfortunately for me, when I got home and ready to eat my sandwich,  instead of extra ranch sauce, there was extra honey mustard... (I specifically mentioned at the window to please make sure to put extra ranch this time).  I didn't eat it.

Customer service is fairly good. I would just suggest paying a little more attention to the customers.",3,a year ago

The Keg Steakhouse + Bar - Windsor Riverside,"1 Riverside Dr W Suite 101, Windsor, ON N9A 5K3, Canada",4.5,sol jun,It was a nice experience all together. We dined in but since the view outside was pretty nice and calming we might dine on the patio next time. You can see out through the big windows from inside as well. Staffs were lovely and food was really great as well. Fillet mignon was great and if you like your steak on the tender side I would recommend fillet mignon. Sandwich was great too. Very flavourful. I would definitely come again. There is a parking garage where you can park your car which is nice since usually it‚Äôs harder to find a parking in the downtown area.

Hellenic Sub,"368 University Ave W, Windsor, ON N9A 5P6, Canada",4.6,Henry,"Waited way too long to finally try the Hellenic sub. There's a reason why this item is at the top of the menu. A beast of a sub with double cold cuts crafted with a layer of their gyros meat. For the price and quality, it puts all other cold cut subs to shame. I usually come here to enjoy the gyros. This sub was a game changer. Don't be snooty, bring cash, enjoy the food. It's about the food.",5,a month ago
Hellenic Sub,"368 University Ave W, Windsor, ON N9A 5P6, Canada",4.6,H.,"I don't know about the previous reviews about saying this place was phenomenal, but it is not. One thing to keep in mind is that this place accepts CASH ONLY, meaning if you don't have cash there will be an ATM in the place but charges you 3 dollars to withdraw money.

I went in about 1pm of the place opening (11:30 am) and the owner said not having enough chicken to make a chicken pita or gyro for two people, which is absurd, because during this time there is rush hour for people having lunch and to not have enough chicken, it does not make sense.

We wanted to know what things were good on the menu to try out, but the owner or manager seemed kind of distracted. The place was not cleaned to eat in there. The floors were dirty and so were the tables and chairs. I wouldn't suggest anyone to dine in.

The only good thing about this place was the freshness of the food. What lacks in this place is providing better customer service.

Though again, I would suggest to bring cash only and to order take-out if you're thinking about eating there. Also come in early at 11:30 am if you want a chicken pita or gyro.",2,a year ago

Panache Restaurant And Lounge,"53 Pitt St E, Windsor, ON N9A 2V3, Canada",4.6,Marissa L,"Really disappointed. Came to Windsor for work, and chose this place based on the reviews and proximity to my hotel. Ordered the panache pretzel with cheese sauce, crispy quinoa salad with poppyseed dressing and arugula, and the sugar cookie dessert. I wanted the peach puff pastry but it wasn't available.
Everything was disappointing. The salad dressing was just syrup with poppyseeds in it. The crispy quinoa were two blocks of quinoa fried so that it was crispy on the outside, but mush on the inside. The pretzel was burnt, and the cheese sauce was more of a liquid with a hint of cheese.
The biggest disappointment was the sugar cookie dessert. They were also burnt, dry and not pleasant to eat. The cookie dip was literally whipped cream with sprinkles in it. Never again.",1,10 months ago

Market Buffet,"377 Riverside Dr E, Windsor, ON N9A 7H7, Canada",3.9,Z. Cai,"Good for Western tastes and a good value sometimes.

Long lines on busy days, which also means the food will have higher turnover and be fresher. Service is average and it can be hard to flag down waiters sometimes. Go for whatever's freshest and you'll have a fairly good meal. Desserts were mediocre thought not too bad. I recommend avoiding the salad bars, though. Some of that stuff looks awful.

Sadly, the food is SO bland and not very good. Lots of variety to choose from...The prime rib was overcooked (along with most other food items). Desserts all tasted the same too even though we tried to get different things :(

""Create your pasta your own way"" station was good though. Also heard that the ""make your own stir fry"" station is good too but we didn't try it.

I'm not even sure how to describe it so I'll just say at least for me this is my favorite restaurant in the city hands down. thank you so much everyone!

I can't believe the cost for the amount of food you get I can't wait to order more from here I'm definitely happy as a Canadian with North American family tree (I hope I'm saying this right) I get to experience food from and made by other cultures.

also I walked in right at closing time and they had no problem taking my order in making my dinner can't help but feel appreciation when I've walked into so many other chain restaurants even 15 minutes to close and was the denied service. I think the guy and he was like well you're paying so thank you you can really tell that they appreciate their customers so I'll never feel bad ordering from this place and it's delicious and and and and what I paid is about one of the most affordable meals around I would testify to that.

Restaurant was fully booked but they let us book a spot at the bar which worked for us. Bartender was super busy but still friendly and never made us feel rushed. Arancini and calamari were great as was the espresso martini. If you're in downtown Windsor looking for a great place to eat that's also reasonably priced you can't go wrong with La Guardia.,5,a week ago

There was very limited selection and not a lot of baked goods (donuts, muffins, bagels) were left at 2:30 am, which has been the case previously when we‚Äôve visited at this time in the past. They only had a couple cinnamon raisin bagels and breads when we arrived. The people in front of us settled on the flatbread pizzas and sandwiches which WERE available.

Then the burgers came, and I asked her twice if it was a gluten free bun because it doesn‚Äôt look like it and my friend asked if her‚Äôs was the vegetarian patty because it looked like meat. She was adamant they were. We both took a bite or 2 when she came running over said she mixed up the orders and handed us each our orders appologizing and asking if I was going to be ok. Saying she would take the fries off and give a big discount. She took 15% off which is only diamond rewards discount.

Amazing Food - super nice Service

Frenchy‚Äôs and their Poutines were recommended to us by our Hotel as the best place to eat Poutine in Windsor - so we tried it. And it was the right choice. The store may look too dark and a little bit worn down. But the waiting customers, who get all their food in a few minutes, showed us that it's worth the wait. The amazing service by the staff guided us through the menus and already indicated that it's gonna be big portions.
We chose the Pulled Pork and the Smoked Meat Poutines with several other toppings. Within a few minutes we got the big servings and were surprised how rich and amazing these Canadian stables are. The gravy is delicious, the plate is filled with cross fries and so much cheese. The Toppings fit into it way too good to the great protein choices and everything makes a big portion of northern soul-food. That the Canadian friendliness is caring for the whole visit for every guest is just the tip of this amazing experience.
Go to Frenchy‚Äôs and enjoy an amazing meal! No recommendation - more of an order! :-)",5,2 years ago

Windsor Palace Restaurant & Catering,"755 Wyandotte St E, Windsor, ON N9A 3J5, Canada",4.3,Rayna Elabed,"Visited Windsor for work and ended up here as a suggestion as most middle eastern restaurants seem to not be open or serving anyone on Sundays, ridiculous. So these guys thankfully were open however maybe wouldn‚Äôt be my first choice, the staff and service were great. Portions are good, just lacking quality. A bit upsetting to see a vegetable oil on hummus, that‚Äôs a staple item - meant to showcase any restaurants level of skill. Maybe it was a bad day? No idea, but the food itself wasn‚Äôt terrible, just missed the mark for me. They did come out with 2 lentil soups and this was 2 mixed grill platters combined. Plus falafel on the side by the pieces and a small tabouli and hummus, came to around $90 I think. Again it‚Äôs not terrible but it‚Äôs not amazing, I‚Äôm going to say it was an off day for them - the kabobs were just too dry and greasy plus hummus was a bit runny. Just little things that make a big difference. There were at least 3 other families dining in and people were ordering out so there‚Äôs definitely a reputation but we didn‚Äôt get greeted with that quality unfortunately. Would I go back? Not sure.

Thanks to the lovely staff for checking on us. We felt bad to say anything to them, they were so sweet.

I recently moved to Windsor and figured all capris would be the same so they would all have the same stuff. I ordered the same chicken finger dinner. It arrives and get lukewarm soggy french fries That you would see in a fish and chips meal And identically JANES Chicken strips Very stale and hard I get 2 cups of barbecue sauce to find out.

Capri Pizzeria,"618 Goyeau St, Windsor, ON N9A 1H7, Canada",3.1,Wolfie Fur,"Delivery was quick, delivery guy friendly, on the phone ordering they had trouble understanding what was said. Pizza was okay for taste but disappointed because very little toppings especially paying $3.50 before tax per gourmet topping. Order a kings size with bbq chicken and bbq chicken was only on 13 out of 32 slices of pizza, less than half of the pizza had the topping I paid for and it was very dry and tasteless the pieces that did have it, ordered extra cheese $3 before tax given same amount of cheese as normal. Ordered roasted garlic that topping was only on 19 out of 32 slices again didn't even have it on most of the pizza. Ordered bacon it wasn't on a single slice of pizza. The only topping they had on every slice was pepperoni. They were being insanely cheap and very low quality. Nothing really good about it. Capri used to make the best pizza in windsor. Now it is sub par at best. Biggest disappointment was the sides. Didnt realize they were the smallest sizes I have ever seen and yet 2-3x the price of sides at other places pictures below. Charged $8.40 before tax for 6 tiny mozzarella sticks the smallest amount and size I have seen for them for a ridiculous price definitely not worth it and they didn't taste very good at all. Far below what was expected from a restaurant that used to have such a good reputation. Charged $5.78 before tax for onion rings, again smallest size I have ever seen for that price and they are mediocre onion rings with an odd taste. Charged $5.20 before tax for a ""coleslaw"" that was mostly lettuce on the bottom to make it look like it was more, also a small amount and tasted nothing like a coleslaw at all and no sauce in it was just sliced cabbage with lemons and lettuce to make it look larger than it was and look better",2,2 years ago
