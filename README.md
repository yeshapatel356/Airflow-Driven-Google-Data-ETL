# Airflow-Driven-Google-Data-ETL
This project leverages Apache Airflow to construct a robust and scalable data pipeline for ingesting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data from Google services. The pipeline efficiently extracts data, cleanses it, and prepares it for further analysis or storage.

## Technologies and Tools:

* Apache Airflow: Orchestrates the ETL pipeline, providing task scheduling, dependency management, and workflow visualization.
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Leverages GCP services for data extraction, transformation, and storage.
* Python: Programming language for data processing and manipulation.
